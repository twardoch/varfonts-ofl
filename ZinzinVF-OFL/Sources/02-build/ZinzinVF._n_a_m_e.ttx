&#13;
PREAMBLE&#13;
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide&#13;
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation&#13;
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and&#13;
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership&#13;
with others.&#13;
&#13;
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and&#13;
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The&#13;
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, &#13;
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved&#13;
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,&#13;
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The&#13;
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply&#13;
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.&#13;
&#13;
